<blockquote>
  "When I was a senior project manager, I sent the hardest problems to Kelly because I knew he could figure it out. I’m not the only one who takes advantage of this skill set; #KellyFix is an often used hashtag at Mediacurrent. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Kelly also explains his approach in a way that everyone can understand. Listening to him break down really complex engineering solutions into every day language not only empowers our clients to make hard decisions, it also elevates the overall brainpower of anyone who was on the project. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Kelly is the engineer you want on your project if you want the project done right from the beginning too. I’m not a developer, but I’ve certainly noticed that his projects have been built to have long legs, can be extended, and have been deeply tested and thought through. His commitment to process has also meant that schedules and budgets are kept - which made my life as a project manager much easier! 
  <br />
  <br />
  After working with Kelly for 2 years, I can’t say enough good things about him."

  "It has been a pleasure to work with Kelly on a number of projects and have him as a colleague to bounce ideas off of. He's extremely professional and a very skilled software engineer and systems administrator with a wealth of knowledge gained from practical experience.
  <br />
  <br />
  It's a comfort whenever we are assigned jointly to a project because I can always be certain that Kelly will go the extra mile to ensure that features he's developing are thoroughly tested, well documented and easy to handoff to other developers. He's an excellent addition to any project team."

  "I've had the fortunate experience to work with Kelly on several development projects over the past few years. I've worked alongside Kelly and also a Project Manager directing and overseeing his work on projects.
  <br />
  <br />
  Kelly is an exceptional programmer who is able to decipher complex requirements, analyze customer requests and deliver optimal solutions. 
  <br />
  <br />
  One thing that makes Kelly stand out from the pack, he is wedded to the fundamentals of computer science, the standards, methods and basic frameworks drive his approach to software development.
  <br />
  <br />
  It was always a pleasure to work with Kelly and I highly recommend his work and services."

  "Kelly is a true engineer.  His approach to software and application development reflect that, as he has a very disciplined manner for designing, building, implementing, and maintaining systems. I've worked with Kelly for several years and he has always delivered a successful solution that is thoroughly thought out.  He has a mastery of Drupal and single sign-on (SSO) integration that makes him second to none.  His wit and personality also make him a great guy to work with."

  "I first met Kelly Beck three years ago when he was recruited to join our Center for Health Information Systems.  Since that time, I have had the pleasure of working closely with him on multiple projects, including some of the company's most high-profile global systems.
  <br />
  <br />
Kelly has an exceptional work ethic and a disciplined engineering perspective, which have served our organization and clients very well.  When he agrees to take on an assignment, he owns it through the entire lifecycle.  I have great respect for his ability to see strategic, long-term benefits and consequences of highly complex technical architectures. In the world of next-generation web applications, one would be hard pressed to find a more skilled "DevOps" software talent than Kelly.
  <br />
  <br />
In short, Kelly Beck is highly respected among a closely held, small core who represent the company's brightest engineers and architects. He will be sorely missed, but make no mistake - his colleagues are all cheering for more great things ahead."

  "Kelly Beck has never failed to amaze and impress me with his absolute tenacity and brilliance at putting together requirements, investigating the technology to best address the given problem in the current environment and execute with laser focus until the problem is no more.  Likely this is solving problems that have never been seen before, using tools for the first time better than most experts of those same tools.  Maybe the most important, when I worked with Kelly I laughed.  It was a special pleasure working with Kelly in over 24 years in the industry."
